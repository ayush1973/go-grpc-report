# System Design: Scaling the Go gRPC Report Service

To scale the report generation service to handle **10,000 concurrent gRPC requests per second** across **multiple data centers**, we must focus on architecture, scalability, reliability, and observability.

---

##  1. Architecture Overview

The current architecture includes:
- A gRPC server exposing `GenerateReport` and `HealthCheck` endpoints.
- In-memory storage for reports.
- A cron job that periodically triggers report generation.

To scale this to a production-grade system, changes are needed in how we deploy, store, and balance traffic.

---

##  2. Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless gRPC Services**: Refactor the service to be stateless. Store reports in an external data store instead of an in-memory map.
- **Multiple Instances**: Deploy multiple instances of the gRPC service using a container orchestration system like **Kubernetes**.
- **Autoscaling**: Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU, memory, or request rate metrics.

---

##  3. Load Balancing

- **gRPC-aware Load Balancer**: Use a gRPC-aware proxy like **Envoy**, **NGINX with HTTP/2**, or **Linkerd** to distribute traffic.
- **Connection Pooling**: Clients should maintain long-lived HTTP/2 connections to reduce handshake overhead.

---

##  4. Storage Layer

- Replace the in-memory map with **persistent storage**:
  - Use a fast key-value store like **Redis** for temporary storage.
  - Use **PostgreSQL**, **CockroachDB**, or **ScyllaDB** for persistent storage and reporting.
- Design the schema for high write throughput and scalable reads.

---

##  5. Reliability and Fault Tolerance

- **Retries and Timeouts**: Configure client and server timeouts and retry policies.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Use a library like `go-resilience` or service mesh features to prevent cascading failures.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse or overload.

---

##  6. Observability

- **Logging**: Use structured logging (e.g., Zap or Logrus).
- **Monitoring**: Integrate **Prometheus** for metrics and **Grafana** for dashboards.
- **Tracing**: Use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing and performance debugging.

---

##  7. Multi-Data Center Deployment

- **Global Load Balancer**: Use **AWS Global Accelerator**, **Cloudflare Load Balancer**, or **GCP Global LB** for geo-distributed traffic routing.
- **Service Discovery**: Use tools like **Consul**, **etcd**, or Kubernetes DNS for multi-region service discovery.
- **Data Replication**: Use cross-region replication in databases with conflict resolution.

##  Summary

| Aspect           | Scalable Approach                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute          | Stateless gRPC + Kubernetes + HPA                      |
| Networking       | Envoy / Linkerd for gRPC load balancing                |
| Storage          | Redis (cache) + PostgreSQL/CockroachDB (persistence)   |
| Fault Tolerance  | Retries, timeouts, circuit breakers                    |
| Monitoring       | Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry                   |
| Global Scaling   | CDN/LB + multi-region clusters + replicated databases  |

This design enables the system to sustain high throughput, low latency, and global reliability.
